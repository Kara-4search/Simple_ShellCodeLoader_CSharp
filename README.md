# Simple_ShellCodeLoader_CSharp

- A simple shellcode loader inspire by (@Subtee) https://twitter.com/subTee
- I change the code a little bit, so now it should be able to bypass windows defender without the shellcode
- If you want to fully bypass windows defender, you gonna need to bypass AMSI and do some works to your shellcode, like obfuscation or encryption(I am gonna update a project soon which is a fully bypass windows defender project, hopefully, it is not too late, cause windows defender may catch up).



## Usage

1. Just replace the shellcode.
2. Launch it through some white list applications
